# DeepCough Research Compilation:

Here I will keep copies of any relavent papers and general research that pertain
to the underlying goal which is to detect and track coughs in a public space
using OTC technology. 

The research will be organized in four folders. 
    -  Visual Detection Methods
    -  Auditory Dection 
    -  Pathophysiology of a cough 
    -  Pathognomonic features of the SARS-Cov-2 virus
